# WEB_Template
Just to get a little jump on new projects when starting, this repo contains barebones boilerplate templates including HTML / CSS (reset and stylesheet) and JavaScript.

When I find I oftentime keep going back to have some of the same code written in new projects, this repo will be updated to remedy that problem.

There will very likely be seperate templates in this repo that are simply components that I oftentime reuse. There's no need to keep repeating myself when I can just grab a template and paste it over. Why rewrite a header on every project?
